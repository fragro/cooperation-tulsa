            <p>At Cooperation Tulsa, our mission is to empower and uplift our community through collective and inclusive practices. Based in Tulsa, we strive to build a more equitable and resilient city by fostering local food sovereignty, expanding communal access to land, and promoting direct democracy.</p>
            <p>Embracing principles of mutual aid and collective action, we are dedicated to creating a network of community gardens and local councils that not only nourish our neighborhoods but also strengthen our shared commitment to social justice and sustainable living.</p>
            <p>We draw inspiration from the work of Murray Bookchin, the democratic confederalism practiced in Rojava, and the community-building efforts of Cooperation Jackson.</p>
